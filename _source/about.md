# About

**Lemma** is a webcomic I've been wanting to make for a long while now, a playful dive into the maddening landscape that is academia and the strange creatures that inhabit it.

Lemma is the companion and prequel to my main webcomic [Flesh Kernel](https://fleshkernel.com). You can read either, none or both in any order.

## Who do you think you are?

I'm [cancrizans canon](https://cancrizans.github.io).

## How did you make this site?

This website is powered by a framework called [Gutta](https://github.com/cancrizans/gutta) which I've developed myself for building minimalist static websites for scrolling webcomics. The sites are fully static which means they're easy and cheap to host.
