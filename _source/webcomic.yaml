      # >
      #       **Abstract:** We present a pedagogical introduction to the recent advances in empirical 
      #       esoteric sciences aimed at apprentices at the graduate level. These notes will instruct
      #       on the status of research-level fieldwork in hydrosemiotics and connected fields at the
      #       boundary of the Region of Interest.
